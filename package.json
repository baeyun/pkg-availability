  "description": "**pkg-availability** is a CLI too for checking npm package name availability. I wrote it as a weekend project to help easen the daunting process of searching for package names one by one on npm. With this tool, I just paste in a list of names and it does the checking. It then outputs a pretty list with details on the availability of each package name.",
